    <p class="text-md-center" class="font-weight-bolder">After eight years in the accounting industry, a season of recruiting and finishing a degree from Arizona State University, 
      I have decided to pursue a career in software development. I began my study working with HTML, CSS, React, Redux and JavaScript through Udemy classes and
      I've been meeting weekly with a mentor who is an established Senior Software Engineer in the programming industry. My current project goals are to complete projects relating to Redux, visual data manipulation and a Google maps demo which will give me the necessary skill set to secure
      a Junior Developer position within this industry. I'm happy to connect with other developers so please feel free to add me to your professional LinkedIn 
      profile, my profile can be found by clicking the LinkedIn icon below.
